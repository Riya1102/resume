    <h1> Swami Vivekananda Early Life and Education </h1>
    <p><em title="italicise the para"> <strong>swami Vivekananda</strong> was born in Calcutta as Narendranath Dutta on 12th January 1863 during the British Government. He belonged to the Bengali family in Calcutta. Vishwanath Dutta was the father of Vivekananda, a successful attorney. Bhuvaneshwari Devi was the mother of Vivekananda, a strong character, good qualities with deep devotion. She was a woman who believed in God and it impacted a lot on his son. He enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidya Sagar’s Institution at the age of 8. After that, he studied at the Presidency College in Calcutta. In 1984, he completed his graduation from the University of Calcutta.<br><br>Vivekananda was born with a yogic nature, always used to do meditation which provided him the mental power. He had a strong memory power since his childhood, so he used to quickly grasp all his school teaching. He gained knowledge in various subjects including History, Sanskrit, Bengali Literature, and Western Philosophy. He had in-depth knowledge of Hindu scriptures like Bhagwat Geeta, Vedas, Ramayan, Upanishads, and Mahabharat. He was a brilliant boy and excelled in music, studies, swimming, and gymnastics.</em></p><hr>
    <h1>Swami Vivekananda Met Ramakrishna Paramahamsa</h1>
    <p>Vivekananda was very eager to see God and know about the existence of God. When he met Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar, he asked him whether he had seen God. He answered, ‘Yes I have’. I see God as clearly as I see you, in a more profound sense. Ramakrishna told him God lives within every human being. So, if we serve mankind, then we can serve God. Influenced by his divine spirituality, Vivekananda accepted Ramakrishna as his guru and started his monk life thereafter.<br><br>
    When he became a monk, he was 25 years old and named as ‘Swami Vivekananda’. Later in his life, he founded the Ramakrishna Mission which is rendering voluntary social service to the poor and distressed irrespective of religion, caste, and creed. He also introduced the Indian Philosophy of Hinduism to western countries and led the ‘Vedanta Movement’. Ramakrishna told his disciples to see Vivekananda as their leader and spread the ‘Vedanta’ philosophy, before his death. He followed Ramakrishna throughout his life and took all his responsibilities after his death.<p><hr>
